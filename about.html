    I am from Karnataka, India. I am coding in HTML, CSS and Javascript for past 5 years and 3 years into python development. i am also a web designer and AI Enhusiastic. I have developed many websites utilizing Artificial Intelligents. last year. I have pick up coding since age of 13 and continuing it. Coding was my passion and I love coding   I that a hurricane would take me somewhere to another country. And once I really ended up in another country - in China, studying at a business school. There I began to travel a lot around Asia in my free time and then moved to work in Munich.<br>
    
    I discovered the world of low-cost airlines and began to fly somewhere and see the world every weekend. Being somewhere in the 15th country, I realized that I had enough experience and knowledge to share with others - and so this blog appeared. Here you will find useful tips, my travel experiences, life hacks and the usual daily thoughts about everything that surrounds me.
